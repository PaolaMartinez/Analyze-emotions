In this repository you can find 3 different files. The one name "modelo.py" goes through the different steps that need to be made in order to prepare the data and build a model for classification. This file uses a LinearSVC for classification, and validation is made through Stratified KFold Cross Validation. 

The file named  "predictor.py" creates a class named Predictor, based on what was done in "modelo.py" for this class to be used by other scripts. And "testing.py" is a unit test file for the class Predictor.
